# Interpretation of the time series plot:

# Unemployment 25-64 
# Seasonal pattern around a relatively stable mean, likely stationary. 

# Unemployment 15-24 
# Apparent fluctuations with apparent cyclical behavior. The mean level seems to change over time, 
# Especially increasing after 2008 and showing high volatility. 
# The series does not appear stationary - it likely has a unit root. 

# Log GDP 
# Follows a upward trend with minor dips. This is probably indicates a non-stationary variable. 

# Quarterly inflation 
# Seasonal pattern with spikes and dips, but no obvious long-term trend. 
# This series may be stationary around a mean with seasonal components. 

# Interest rate 
# Bounded, lower-level variation, especially in later years. 
# The series looks stationary or weakly non-stationary. 

# Youth LFP 
# Fluctuations around a relatively stable mean, likely stationary.

# Engle-Granger cointegration test
# Cointegration is about testing whether non-stationary series have a stationary linear combination.

# When working with variables that are l(1) (i.e non-stationary in levels, but
# stationary after first difference), a test for cointegration in levels have to be done, not in differences. 

# H0: the series are not cointegrated
# If we reject the null the two series are cointegrated 

# Compare test statistic to S&W Table p.665
# Significance:  10%      5%      1%
# 1 regressors: -3.12 # -3.41 # -3.96
# 2 regressors: -3.52 # -3.80 # -4.36
# 3 regressors: -3.84 # -4.16 # -4.73
# 4 regressors: -4.20 # -4.49 # -5.07

###############################################################################

# Variable order matters in Cholesky decomposition
# The ordering of the variables determines which variables are allowed to react 
# contemporaneously to others. 

# Justification of the order: 

# Log-differenced GDP is somewhat more reactive than unemployment but still reflects aggregate demand/supply shocks 
# that take time to materialize.

# Inflation reflects macroeconomic trends (e.g., supply chain pressures, wage growth), which respond to both 
# monetary policy and real activity.
# You can argue that inflation adjusts more slowly than interest rates, 
# but for this model i decide that this is most appropriate. 

# Interest rate are set relatively quickly in response to inflaiton, 
# unemployment, or GDP data. So this is ordered after inflation and GDP. 

# Youth LFP is more flexible and responsive to current labor market conditions 
# (e.g., they may choose to work or study). 

# Youth unemployment is highly sensitive to shocks and fluctuates more than total unemployment.

# SC imposes stronger penalty on model complexity and is more suitable because it captures

plot(var_forecast$forecast$unemployment_15_24,
     main = "Forecast: Unemployment 15-24",
     ylab = "Percentage",
     xlab = "Time")

# Interpretation 
# Youth unemployment shows strong seasonality and cyclical variation. The model captures this by projecting a wavy forecast line. 
# However, the fan widening indicates higher long-run forecast uncertainty. Youth unemployment is less predictable than inflation or GDP growth.

# Forecast GDP growth
plot(var_forecast$forecast$dlgdp,
     main = "Forecast: GDP Growth",
     ylab = "Growth rate",
     xlab = "Time")

# Interpretation 
# The model predicts relatively stable GDP growth, reverting to a steady average post-2020. 
# The sharp dip around 2020 is the COVID-19 shock. The forecast is centered around zero, with wide uncertainty bands, 
# reflecting uncertainty in economic activity recovery.

# Forecast inflation
plot(var_forecast$forecast$inflation_q,
     main = "Forecast: Inflation",
     ylab = "Rate (%)",
     xlab = "Time")

# Interpretation
# The model expects inflation to stabilize around a new mean level after a post-pandemic shock (large volatility spike around 2020). 
# However, there's substantial uncertainty, especially in the longer horizon (note the widening fan).

# Forecast interest rate
